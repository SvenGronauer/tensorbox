# TensorBox
A personalized neural network toolbox for research purposes. 
Built upon the TensorFlow 2.0alpha framework and TensorFlow's Keras.

I like to provide an easy high-level usage of the functions 
while enhancing the Keras framework with logging functions, 
more sophisticated networks and advanced optimization methods. 

## Installation
1) Git clone the project
2) Navigate into directory with ``cd ./tensorbox``
3) Install with pip via ``pip install -e .``

## Examples



## RL Algorithms

implemented algorithms comprise
* PPO - Proximal Policy Optimization (discrete is working, continous not)

upcoming:
* IMPALA 

## Optimization Methods

* Gradient Descent
* Levenberg-Marquardt for Regression Problems

## Neural Network Models
Standard:
* Shared Multi-Layer Perceptron

Images:
* U-Net (contains still bugs)

## Datasets

The following datasets are provided
* Regression Problems: Lissajous
* Segmentation: Tetris
